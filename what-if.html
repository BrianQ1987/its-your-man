                        <h2>The Godfather (1972)</h2>
                        <p>Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece <em>The Godfather</em> seemlessly blends gritty crime with art house sensibilites and, for many is the pinnacle film of the so-called <em>New Hollywood</em> generation of directors.</p>
                        <p>With its cast comprising a rich array of heavyweight thesps such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Diane Keaton as well as having many character actors such as Abe Vigoda and Alex Rocco fill out the supporting roles, you might think there would be no room for Richard Kind in an already bloated production.</p>
                        <p>All one has to do is look to the infamous Italian restaurant scene in which Michael gets his first taste of the family business by publicly executing rival gangster Viril Solozzo and the corrput police captain McCluskey in full view of dining patrons. The scene is a master class in tension building, in sound design and in letting you know exactly what each character is thinking with very little dialog spoken.</p>
                        <p>But it doesn't feel very realistic. We know what Americans are like at dinner time. They have very loud conversations, are always complaining about service and doing ignorant things like referring to main courses as <em>"entr√©es"</em>. Enter New Jersey born <strong>Richard Kind</strong>. Having played Larry's predantic cousin Andy David on <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> he is no stranger to making tedious demands of waiters or sending back soup for being too cold. Perhaps he could have been using the toilet stall where Michael had the murder weapon stashed forcing Michael to wait in line that bit longer.</p>
                        <p>Or perhaps, after the murders, had been committed he could have been the one to confront Michael, yelling <em>"Not today, buddy!"</em> leaving Michael little recourse than to commit a third murder that evening.</p>

                            <h2>Air Bud (1997)</h2>
                            <p>The 1990s were a peak time for high-concept basketball movies such as <i>Space Jam</i>, <i>Flubber</i> and, of course, everyone's favourite dunkin' Golden Retriever, <i>Air Bud</i>!</p>
                            <p>Air Bud tells the story of Buddy, an abused pooch who escapes his life of being an alcoholic birthday party clown's assistant and find his way into Josh's life. Josh is an awkward High School kid who has just recently lost his father and is having trouble fitting in school. In steps Buddy who not only becomes a surrogate father of sorts to Josh but also becomes the star player on the school's basketball team.</p>
                            <p>Despite making almost ten times its budget at the box office, <i>Air Bud</i> is a distant memory for many and is nowhere to be found on Disney's premium streaming service, <i>Disney+</i>. Perhaps this is due to Disney wanting to distance themselves from producer Harvey Weinstein or, more likely, there is a spare pair of Air Jordans in this story that can only be filled by one <strong>Richard Kind</strong>!</p>
                            <p>It would only make sense, with a keen eye on animal welfare, that the hoop shooting dog contrivance be scrapped from the plot and Richard Kind be cast in the title role. With his everyman charm he could provide Josh with sagely advice and, despite being a middle aged star of stage and screen Richard Kind could probably dribble a ball better than most pure bred pooches.</p>

                            <h2>Casablanca (1942)</h2>
                            <p>Beloved by many, <i>Casablanca</i>, has one of the greatest, if not most divisive endings in cinema history. Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine valiantly, gives up on true love and allows Ilsa leave on the plane with her husband so that their important work in the Nazi resistance might continue.</p>
                            <p>There isn't a dry eye in the house when the final credits role but many are left wondering how Ilsa can choose the pragmatic Victor Laszlo over the more romantic engima Rick Blaine.</p>
                            <p>It's heartbreaking for sure, but there's also a number of Sally Albrights out there who understand Ilsa's position and that's probably because the actor playing Victor Laszlo, Paul Henreid, is another handsome leading man type.</p>
                            <p>Despite filming having wrapped in August 1942, 14 years before he was born, this is where <strong>Richard Kind</strong> would have shone. An un-attractive, though emotive, face could still have conveyed a hatred of the Nazis and a desire to overthrow tyranny but also make the audience want Ingrid Bergman to get on the plane with Bogey <em>even more</em>!</p>
                            <p>Maybe they could fix this up with AI or something.</p>
