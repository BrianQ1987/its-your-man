        <p>Despite having acted in over 59 movies, <strong>Richard Kind</strong> is not a name that many people would recognise. He does, however have one of those faces that when you see it you go: <em>"Oh, it's your man!"</em></p>
        <p>Whether it's playing hypochondriac patient Harvey Corman on four episodes of <i>Scrubs</i> or providing the voice of Bing Bong in Pixar's <i>Inside Out</i> each performance given by Richard Kind is memorable but not memorable enough to stop you getting out your phone, going to IMDb just to remind yourself <em>"What do I know him from?"</em></p>
        <p>Below, is some information on his most memorable roles. Click on each of the titles to expand for more information.</p>

                        <p><strong>Richard Kind</strong> plays the role of Bing Bong, Riley's imaginary friend. Social, cheerful and lively - it's the role Richard Kind was born to play!</p>
                        <p>We meet Riley at a time in her life when she is speaking to Bing Bong less and less. This doesn't stop Bing Bong from helping Riley's emotions on their quest to help restore Riley's happiness.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately Bing Bong sacrifices his life for Riley and fades away in her memory dump. Forgotten forever. Much like the name "Richard Kind".</p>
